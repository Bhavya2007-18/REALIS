=== Phase 2A Verification: Impulse Dynamics ===

--- 1D Elastic Collision Testing (dt=0.01) ---
Before Collision:
  E_total: 5.5 J
  P_total: (1, 0, 0) kg m/s
  v1: 2 m/s
  v2: -1 m/s

Collision occurred around t = 2.67 s
After Collision:
  E_total: 5.5 J (Error: 4.29153e-006 J)
  P_total: (1, 0, 0) kg m/s (Error: 4.76837e-007 kg m/s)
  v1: -1.6 m/s (Expected: -1.6 m/s)
  v2: 1.4 m/s (Expected: 1.4 m/s)
