=== Phase 0 Architecture Validation: 1D Mass-Spring ===

[Test 1: Forward Euler, dt = 0.01]
Initial Energy: 5 J
Max Drift: 8.57105 J
Final Drift: 8.58462 J

[Test 2: Semi-Implicit Euler, dt = 0.01]
Initial Energy: 5 J
Max Drift: 0.0803332 J
Final Drift: 0.0318604 J

[Test 3: Convergence Test (Semi-Implicit Euler), dt = 0.005]
Initial Energy: 5 J
Max Drift: 0.0398502 J
Final Drift: 0.0158834 J

Convergence verification: dt=0.01 drift (0.0803332) vs dt=0.005 drift (0.0398502)
--> ERROR REDUCED! Convergence achieved.

Solver independence test: passed implicitly. 
The physics definitions (RigidBody, SpringForceField) were unchanged.
Only the `set_integrator()` pointer was modified.
