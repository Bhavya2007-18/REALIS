=== Phase 1 Architecture Validation: 1D Uniform Gravity ===

[Test 1: Forward Euler, dt = 0.01]
Max Energy Drift: 0.962547 J
Max Position Error: 0.0981073 m
L2 Norm Error: 0.804003

[Test 2: Semi-Implicit Euler, dt = 0.01]
Max Energy Drift: 0.962173 J
Max Position Error: 0.098093 m
L2 Norm Error: 0.803969

[Test 3: Convergence Test (Semi-Implicit Euler), dt = 0.005]
Max Energy Drift: 0.481407 J
Max Position Error: 0.0490694 m
L2 Norm Error: 0.567551

Convergence verification: dt=0.01 error (0.098093) vs dt=0.005 error (0.0490694)
--> ERROR REDUCED! Convergence achieved.

Solver independence test: passed implicitly. 
The physics configuration was unchanged.
Only the integrators were swapped.
