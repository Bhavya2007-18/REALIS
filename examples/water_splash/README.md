# Water Splash Example

Fluid simulation using SPH.

## Description

Water particles splash in a container.

## Physics Concepts

- Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH)
- Navier-Stokes approximation
- Surface tension
- Viscosity

## Running

```bash
python run_water_splash.py
```

## Validation

- Incompressibility maintained
- Volume conservation
- Realistic fluid behavior
- Proper boundary conditions
