# Double Pendulum Example

Demonstration of chaotic dynamics.

## Description

Two connected pendulums exhibiting chaotic motion.

## Physics Concepts

- Multi-body constraints
- Chaotic systems
- Sensitivity to initial conditions
- Energy conservation in constrained systems

## Running the Example

```bash
python run_double_pendulum.py
```

## Expected Behavior

- Initially smooth oscillation
- Transition to chaotic motion
- Sensitive dependence on initial conditions
- Phase space shows complex attractor

## Validation

- Total energy conserved (no dissipation)
- Constraints maintained (fixed lengths)
- Lyapunov exponent > 0 (chaos indicator)
