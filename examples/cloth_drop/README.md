# Cloth Drop Example

Soft body physics demonstration.

## Description

A piece of cloth falls and drapes over an obstacle.

## Physics Concepts

- Mass-spring system
- Soft body deformation
- Self-collision
- Contact with rigid bodies

## Running

```bash
python run_cloth.py
```

## Validation

- Cloth maintains structural integrity
- No self-penetration
- Realistic draping behavior
- Energy dissipation from damping
